PyGestures
==========

Simple hand gesture recognition, unfinished and tested on very small train data(insufficient to evaluate!).

##Install

PyGestures is a relatively small project, because it uses libraries for computer vision and neural networks.
To run it, you need:

*numpy
*OpenCV with Python bindings
*Qt4 with Python bindings
*[pybrain](ttp://pybrain.org/docs/quickstart/installation.html)

##Usage

Just type:
'
python src/main.py
'

The example train data files are in 'train data' directory, with file 'classes' containing names of gestures.
